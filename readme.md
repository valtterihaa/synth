This synth was inspired by Kyle from the YouTube channel Web Dev Simplified.
I watched the video, and the next day, I went about trying to copy that process WITHOUT using the video for help!

The synth works with the keys Z, X, C, V, B, N, and M for the white keys and S, D, G, H, and J for the black keys.

I made the sounds myself in Reaper using ReaSynth and Helm by Matt Tytel.

My aim was to have the sounds loop when pressing a key down, but in a browser there's a brief delay between when the sound file stops and starts again.

I also need to connect the keyboard keys to the keys on screen.

I will attempt to fix these issues without referencing the video!
